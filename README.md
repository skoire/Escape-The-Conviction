# Escape-The-Conviction
Escape the Room meets Science Crime Busters in this VR game built for the Oculus Touch.

You are the main suspect in a criminal investigation. You break into the evidence room to try to prove your innocence. If you can figure out who the real criminal is without getting caught, you will anonymously tip off the police and escape a free person.

Interact with objects using the trigger on your Right Oculus Touch controller.
